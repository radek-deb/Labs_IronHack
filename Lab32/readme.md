## This is my solution for Lab32 | Intro to Data Preparation

In this lab I firstly uploaded data to pandas and I analysed it using describe function and shape function. Based on that I established a plan to clean and prapare the data for analysis. 
  The plan included: 
  1. Describing the data 
  2. Check for missing values 
  3. Deal with missing valies
  4. Check if there are any columns that can be droped
  5. Check for incorrect values/consistancy(lower/upper case, special characters etc.)
  6. Check for outliers/Remove the data that is souspicious 
  7. Encode the non numerical data 

The descritption of each step is presented in the jupyter notebook. 
  The results cleaned and prepared data were saved into data_cleaned.csv file
