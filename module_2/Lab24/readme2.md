## Lab 24 | Data Visualization with Tableau

### Part 1

**Task3:** I guess that this parameter doesn't show the total number of games as each game is counted twice. For example: 

| 2010 | 09/09/2010 | 1 | Away | Minnesota Vikings  | 9  | New Orleans Saints | 14 | Loss |
|------|------------|---|------|--------------------|----|--------------------|----|------|
| 2010 | 09/09/2010 | 1 | Home | New Orleans Saints | 14 | Minnesota Vikings  | 9  | Win  |
