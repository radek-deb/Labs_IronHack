### Article number 9: Videogames against malaria: Learn through playing

This article presents a research project created at the Technical University of Madrid in 2016. 
The goal of the project was to develop a videogame in which players identify 5 type of parasites present in the blood samples of patients with malaria by shooting the bubbles with them.
The final aim is to develop a new diagnostic tool of malaria disease by using non-expert players. It is important as the type of parasite present in the blood affects the type of treatment patient gets. 

**Machine Learning in the project**: 

The Machine learning is in learning how the students (as the game was tested first on the group of students) acquire the skill to recognize the samples of blood with malaria parasites through gaming. This in the future may allow to develop a new diagnostic tool for malaria.
